# Refactoring Documentation

## Initial Analysis

### Project Overview

- CLI tool to interact with AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Main functionality: Read parameters and convert to environment variables
- Additional features: Create, modify, and delete parameters
- Written in Go with focus on standard library usage

### Dependencies Review

- Uses AWS SDK Go v2 (aws-sdk-go-v2) - Latest version
- Uses Cobra for CLI framework - Latest version (1.8.1)
- Uses yaml.v3 for configuration - Latest version
- All dependencies appear to be actively maintained and up-to-date

### Code Structure

- Clean separation of concerns with internal packages:
  - aws/: AWS-specific functionality
  - logger/: Logging functionality
  - config/: Configuration handling
- Main application logic in root directory
- Tests directory for integration tests
- Comprehensive documentation in docs/

### Initial Findings

1. Project uses Go version 1.23.3
1. Need to review each package for:
  - Code documentation (godoc)
  - Unit test coverage
  - Code quality and best practices
  - Security considerations

## Changes Log

### 1. Go Version Update

- **Current State**: Project uses Go version 1.23.3
- **Action**: Updated to Go 1.24.0
- **Reasoning**:
  - Go 1.24.0 is the latest stable version (released February 6, 2024)
  - Updating to the latest stable version provides access to newest features
  - Following the practice of keeping dependencies current when possible
  - All tests pass successfully with Go 1.24.0
- **Impact**: Project benefits from latest Go improvements and optimizations

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- **Issue**: Code documentation was missing or incomplete in several key areas
- **Action**: Added comprehensive godoc-style documentation to:
  - main.go: Added package overview and configuration precedence details
  - cmd/root.go: Added package documentation, improved function and variable docs
  - internal/logger/logger.go: Added package overview, detailed function docs
  - internal/aws/ssm.go: Added package overview, improved error handling
  - internal/config/config.go: Added comprehensive package and type documentation
- **Reasoning**:
  - Good documentation is crucial for maintainability and contributor onboarding
  - Following Go's best practices for documentation improves IDE integration
  - Examples in documentation help users understand the intended usage
- **Impact**:
  - Better developer experience through improved IDE documentation
  - Clearer understanding of package purposes and relationships
  - More maintainable codebase with well-documented interfaces

### 3. Configuration Package Improvements

- **Issue**: Configuration handling lacked validation and proper error handling
- **Action**: Enhanced the config package with:
  - Added comprehensive package documentation explaining configuration precedence
  - Introduced proper error types and validation
  - Improved error messages with more context
  - Added validation for output format and required fields
  - Enhanced merging behavior documentation
  - Added detailed type documentation for Config and ParamConfig structs
- **Reasoning**:
  - Configuration validation is crucial for preventing runtime errors
  - Clear error messages help users identify and fix configuration issues
  - Well-documented types and fields improve usability
  - Proper error handling makes the package more robust
- **Impact**:
  - More reliable configuration handling
  - Better user experience through clear error messages
  - Reduced potential for runtime errors
  - Improved maintainability through clear documentation

### 4. AWS Package Improvements

- **Issue**: AWS package had inconsistent error handling and lacked documentation
- **Action**: Enhanced the AWS package with:
  - Added comprehensive package documentation with examples
  - Introduced proper error types for common error cases
  - Improved error messages with more context
  - Added input validation for all functions
  - Added constants for parameter types
  - Improved KMS key handling for SecureString parameters
- **Reasoning**:
  - Consistent error handling improves reliability
  - Type safety through constants prevents errors
  - Input validation catches issues early
  - Better documentation helps users understand AWS interactions
- **Impact**:
  - More reliable AWS operations
  - Better error messages for troubleshooting
  - Improved security through proper KMS handling
  - Better maintainability through clear documentation

### 5. Command Package Improvements

- **Issue**: Command implementations were monolithic and lacked documentation
- **Action**: Enhanced the command package with:
  - Split large command functions into smaller, focused functions
  - Added comprehensive documentation for each command
  - Added usage examples for all commands
  - Improved error handling and messages
  - Added proper validation for all command flags
  - Improved configuration merging logic
  - Added consistent output formatting
- **Reasoning**:
  - Smaller functions are easier to understand and maintain
  - Examples help users understand command usage
  - Consistent error handling improves user experience
  - Better validation prevents runtime errors
- **Impact**:
  - More maintainable command implementations
  - Better user experience through clear documentation
  - More reliable command execution
  - Consistent behavior across all commands

Each change will be documented here as we progress through the codebase review
and refactoring.
